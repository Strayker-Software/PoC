# Strayker Software Proof of Concept Collection

In this repository organisation is storing source code of all PoCs ever created for our production works.

If some project status shows, that given project is on "PoC" phase, this means that files of this work will be located here.

There also can be situation, where PoC files provided in repo are not belonging to any project, that means: project was removed from organisation, or this was only checking up a single thing.

## Repo Workflow

This repo is not included into default organisation's procedures.

## Licensing

Every PoC is licensed under license terms provided in main repo's directory.

Given PoC can be licensed differently, in this situation license will be provided in given PoC's path separately.
